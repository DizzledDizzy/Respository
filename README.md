# Respository
Welcome to Noah's Grade 12 ISU repository! Here, you can find all of the information about my project. 

The project that I have been working on is a recreation of the game Minesweeper, fully built in Python. The purpose of this project is to accurately reflect on the Python skills that I have learned throughout the semester. 

By the middle of June, I intend to finish my project by making a fully playable version of Minesweeper using Object Oriented Programming in Python. To achieve this goal, I will be using Python to code my program on Visual Studio Code.
